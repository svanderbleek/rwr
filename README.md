# rwr

the world's cutest javascript term rewriting system

Roadmap

- [ ] representations for expression, term
- [ ] rwr.rewrite(expression, rule) action
- [ ] rwr.logic rewrite logic, proofs in rewrite systems
- [ ] rwr.wolf mathematica interop
- [ ] rwr.redex racket redex implementation
- [ ] rwr.turnstile racket turnstile implementation
- [ ] rwr.webasm compile to webassembly?
- [ ] apply to rwr.lof by buidling self interpreting spartan

## rwr language

ee will implement rwr a javascript rewriting interpreter. The API is minimal.

```
match(expression, rule) 
rewrite(expression, rule)
evaluate(expression, environment)
```

It is inspired by mathematica and TRS presented in literature such as Term Rewriting Systems and Advanced Topics in Term Rewriting.

rwr implements a rewriting logic and type checking ideas can be ported through this logic.
