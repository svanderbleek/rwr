# rwrr

the internet's cutest javascript term rewriting system

Roadmap

- [ ] representations for expression, term
- [ ] rwrr.rewrite(expression, rule) action
- [ ] rwrr.logic rewrite logic, proofs in rewrite systems
- [ ] rwrr.wolf mathematica interop
- [ ] rwrr.redex racket redex implementation
- [ ] rwrr.turnstile racket turnstile implementation
- [ ] rwrr.webasm compile to webassembly?
- [ ] apply to rwrr.lof by buidling self interpreting spartan

## rwrr language

We will implement rwrr a javascript rewriting interpreter. The API is minimal.

```
match(expression, rule) 
rewrite(expression, rule)
evaluate(expression, environment)
```

It is inspired by mathematica and TRS presented in literature such as Term Rewriting Systems and Advanced Topics in Term Rewriting.

Rwrrr implements a rewriting logic and type checking ideas can be ported through this logic.

Expression

```
{Expression:{}}
```

Rewrite

```
replace({Expression1:{}}, {Expression1: {Expression2: {}}) == {Expression2:{}}
```
